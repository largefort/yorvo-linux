# Yorvo Linux

**Yorvo** is a new, independent Linux distribution being built completely **from scratch** — not based on Debian, Arch, or Ubuntu.  

The goal of Yorvo is to create a system that is:  
- 🛰 **Independent** — starting with its own toolchain and base system.  
- 📦 **Powered by `ypkg`** — a custom package manager and package format.  
- 🌌 **Unique in identity** — with a cosmic, geometric, and futuristic branding style.  
- 📖 **Educational & transparent** — so anyone can learn how a Linux distro is made.

- Packaging & repository setup  
- Artwork & theming  
- ISO testing  
- Documentation
