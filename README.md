# Yorvo Linux

**Yorvo** is a new, independent Linux distribution being built completely **from scratch** â€” not based on Debian, Arch, or Ubuntu.  

The goal of Yorvo is to create a system that is:  
- ðŸ›° **Independent** â€” starting with its own toolchain and base system.  
- ðŸ“¦ **Powered by `ypkg`** â€” a custom package manager and package format.  
- ðŸŒŒ **Unique in identity** â€” with a cosmic, geometric, and futuristic branding style.  
- ðŸ“– **Educational & transparent** â€” so anyone can learn how a Linux distro is made.

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap (Phases)

### Phase 1 â€” Bootstrapping Base System *(current)*
- Kernel, toolchain, libc, init, core utilities  
- Document build process  

### Phase 2 â€” Package Manager: `ypkg`
- Define package format & repo structure  
- Basic CLI (install, remove, update, search)  

### Phase 3 â€” Repositories
- Host packages in Yorvo repos  
- Base packages (bash, networking, editors)  
- Desktop environment support  

### Phase 4 â€” Artwork & Identity

- GRUB splash + installer branding  

### Phase 5 â€” Installer & ISOs
