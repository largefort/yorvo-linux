# Yorvo Linux Roadmap

Yorvo is a new **independent Linux distribution** being built completely from scratch â€” not based on Debian, Arch, or Ubuntu.  
This roadmap outlines the development plan and the roles where contributors can help.

---

## Phase 1 â€” Bootstrapping the Base System *(current stage)*

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Build a minimal Linux system from scratch.  

**Tasks**
- Build and configure the Linux kernel.  
- Bootstrap compiler toolchain (binutils, GCC/LLVM).  
- Add essential libraries (glibc or musl).  
- Add core utilities (coreutils, util-linux, init system).  
- Document the build process (similar to Linux From Scratch).  

**Contributors Needed**
- Compiler/toolchain enthusiasts  
- libc/init experts  
- Documenters to write build notes  

---

## Phase 2 â€” Package Manager: `ypkg`

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Create Yorvoâ€™s own package manager.  

**Tasks**
- Define package format (`.ypkg`) with metadata and control files.  
- Write a simple CLI tool for installing/removing/searching/updating.  
- Implement dependency handling.  
- Design repository structure and indexing.  

**Contributors Needed**
- Developers with Bash, Python, or C experience  
- People familiar with apt, pacman, or xbps concepts  

---

## Phase 3 â€” Repositories & Package Ecosystem

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Establish Yorvoâ€™s own repositories and package set.  

**Tasks**
- Host packages on GitHub/GitLab or a self-hosted repo.  
- Build a set of **base packages** (bash, networking tools, text editors).  
- Automate builds with CI/CD pipelines.  

**Contributors Needed**
- Packagers  
- Sysadmins  
- Testers  

---

## Phase 4 â€” Desktop Environments

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Provide users with the option to install different desktop environments (DEs).  

**Tasks**
- Package and provide common desktop environments such as:  
  - GNOME  
  - XFCE  
  - KDE Plasma  
  - LXQt / lightweight options  
- Ensure compatibility with Yorvoâ€™s package manager (`ypkg`).  
- Provide default Yorvo theming for consistency.  
- Test DEs in both VM and hardware installs.  

**Contributors Needed**
- Packagers with DE experience  
- Testers on different hardware  
- Themers for desktop integration  

---

## Phase 5 â€” Artwork & Identity

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Give Yorvo a unique, professional look.  

**Tasks**
- Design Yorvo logo (cosmic, geometric, futuristic).  
- Create wallpapers and Plymouth boot theme.  
- GRUB splash and installer branding.  
- Define Yorvoâ€™s color palette & style guide.  

**Contributors Needed**
- Designers  
- Themers  
- UI/UX contributors  

---

## Phase 6 â€” Installer & ISOs

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Make Yorvo installable and user-friendly.  

**Tasks**
- Create live ISO with minimal desktop.  
- Build or adapt an installer (TUI or Calamares fork).  
- Test installations across real hardware and VMs.  
- Document the installation process.  

**Contributors Needed**
- ISO builders  
- Installer developers  
- Testers  

---

## Phase 7 â€” Community & Expansion

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Grow Yorvo into a sustainable, community-driven project.  

**Tasks**
- Set up community spaces (forums, Matrix, Discord).  
- Write developer and user documentation.  
- Recruit translators and testers.  
- Submit Yorvo to **Distrowatch** once stable.  

**Contributors Needed**
- Community builders  
- Documentation writers  
- Translators  
- Testers

## Closing Notes

Yorvo starts small â€” with a bootstrap base and a new package manager â€” and will grow step by step into a fully independent Linux distribution.
